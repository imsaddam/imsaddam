I am a results-driven QA Engineer with 3–5 years of experience in end-to-end manual and automation testing, with a strong focus on delivering high-quality software solutions in the financial and banking sector. My background includes hands-on work with Selenium, Katalon Studio, TestNG, Robot Framework, and Postman, supported by a solid foundation in Computer Science (Bachelor’s + Master’s).

My experience spans major financial institutions in Luxembourg. At the European Investment Bank, I automate functional, integration, and API tests using Java, Groovy, Bash, Katalon, and Selenium, reducing manual testing efforts by 80%. I also work extensively with CI/CD pipelines, SQL databases, and security tools such as WALLIX PAM. Previously at Advanzia Bank, I led manual and automation testing for SEPA payment flows, reducing defect resolution time by 30% and automating over 150 regression test cases.

Before moving into banking, I sharpened my testing skills through freelance projects at uTest, completing 250+ test cycles for global brands and identifying 200+ critical bugs across high-impact applications. My background also includes open-source contribution at Mozilla Firefox and research support at the University of Luxembourg, giving me a versatile perspective across development, testing, and compliance.

I enjoy working in Agile teams, solving complex technical challenges, and continuously improving my skillset—supported by ISTQB training, multiple testing certifications, CI/CD experience, and hands-on programming in Java, Groovy, Python, and shell scripting. My goal is to contribute to high-performing teams where quality, collaboration, and innovation are valued.
